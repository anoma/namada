## About Namada
* [Namada](https://namada.net/) is the first fractal instance of [Anoma](https://anoma.net)

- Trustless 2-way Ethereum bridge via IBC implementation on ETH
- IBC bridges to chains that already speak IBC (all Cosmos chains)
- MASP
- Convert Circuit (shielded set rewards)
- A reference interface
- Ledger application
