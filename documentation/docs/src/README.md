# Introduction

Welcome to Namada's docs!

## About Namada

[Namada](https://namada.net/) is a Proof-of-Stake layer 1 protocol for asset-agnostic, interchain privacy. Namada is Namada's first fractal instance and is currently being developed by [Heliax](https://heliax.dev), a public goods lab.

Key innovations include:
- ZCash-like transfers for any assets (fungible and non-fungible)
- Rewarded usage of privacy as a public good
- Interoperability with Ethereum via a custom bridge with trust-minimisation
- Vertically integrated user interfaces

## Overview of features
- Proof-of-Stake with governance to secure and evolve Namada
- Fast-finality BFT with 4-second blocks
- Near-zero fees
- Trustless 2-way Ethereum bridge via IBC implementation on ETH
- IBC bridges to chains that already speak IBC (all Cosmos chains)
- MASP
- Convert Circuit (shielded set rewards)
- A reference interface
- Ledger application
