# Introduction

Welcome to Namada's docs!

## About Namada

Namada is a sovereign, proof-of-stake blockchain protocol that enables private, asset-agnostic cash and private bartering among any number of parties. To learn more about the protocol, we recommend the following resources:

- [Introducing Namada: Interchain Asset-agnostic Privacy](https://blog.namada.net/introducing-namada-interchain-asset-agnostic-privacy/)
- [Namada's mission](https://forum.namada.net/t/the-namada-mission/275)

> ⚠️ Here lay dragons: this codebase is still experimental, try at your own risk!

## About the documentation

The two main sections of this book are:

- [Exploration](./explore): documents the process of exploring the design and implementation space for Namada
- [Specifications](./specs): implementation independent technical specifications

### The source

This book is written using [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) with [mdbook-mermaid](https://github.com/badboy/mdbook-mermaid) for diagrams, it currently lives in the [Namada repo](https://github.com/anoma/namada).

To get started quickly, in the `docs` directory one can:

```shell
# Install dependencies
make dev-deps

# This will open the book in your default browser and rebuild on changes
make serve
```

The mermaid diagrams docs can be found at <https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid>.

[Contributions](https://github.com/anoma/namada/issues) to the contents and the structure of this book (nothing is set in stone) should be made via pull requests. Code changes that diverge from the spec should also update this book.
