- Indexers fail to identify the types of older txs since these types use wasm hashes. If those hashes were overwritten by governance proposals, the indexer is unable to determine how to deserialize these txs. This PR adds a new key to storage which allows looking up a tx type from a wasm hash, even if that hash is of code no longer in use. ([\#4690](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/4690))
