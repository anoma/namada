  ([\#3645](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/3645))

### FEATURES

 - Partially addresses Issue [\#2900](https://github.com/anoma/namada/issues/2900). Viewing and spending keys can now
   be given birthdays in the form of block heights which are loaded into 
   shielded sync. Shielded sync will not try to decrypt a block before a 
   keys birthday with said key. ([\#3653](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/3653))
- The command `namadan utils test-genesis` now accepts `--check-can-sign`
  multi-arg that can be used with genesis addresses and/or public keys to
  verify that a pre-genesis wallet in the base directory is able to sign
  with the keys associated with the addresses or with the keys themselves.
  ([\#3660](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/3660))

  action. ([\#3632](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/3632))
- Do not load context for `namadan utils test-genesis` command.
  ([\#3652](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/3652))
- Speeds up client commands on networks with massive balances.toml
  files. Previously, to retrieve the native token of some network,
  we had to parse these giant files. Now, we only parse the
  necessary genesis toml files required to retrieve the native token.
  ([\#3655](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/3655))

### SDK

- Parallelize the shielded sync implementation in Namada.

      ([\#3498](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/3498))
- Improved the interface of the gas type. Removed the duplicated gas used from
  events. ([\#3428](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/3428))
- Implement the phase 2 masp shielded sync client. This client uses
  a [`namada-masp-indexer`](https://github.com/anoma/namada-masp-
  indexer) instance to query the state of the shielded context.
  ([\#3456](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/3456))

   - Add the ability to create chunkable snapshots to our rocksdb implementation
   - Spawn a background task to create snapshots are certain blockheights

   Specifically adds a config parameter that indicates after how many blocks a 
   snapshot should be created. If set, then on the corresponding calls to commit,
   a background task is spun up that takes a snapshot of rocksDB and writes it
   in a convenient format to a file. This file contains metadata of how to be 
   broken up into chunks. Once a new snapshot is created, older snapshots are
   removed. ([\#3383](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/3383))
 - Addresses the third point and part of the fourth point of Issue
   [\#3307](https://github.com/anoma/namada/issues/3307)

  PoS and shielded inflation modules are wrappers around this controller.
  ([\#2575](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2575))
- Instead of having every user tx be executed across two blocks, the first executing a wrapper and the 
  second executing the main payload, this change makes it so that the entire tx is executed in a single
  block (or rejected). ([\#2627](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2627)) 
- Only load governance proposals on a new epoch right before execution.
  Decoupled the logic from the Shell and implemented in the gov crate.
  ([\#2630](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2630))

   This PR moves many e2e tests over to integration test. In the future, it may be possible to move more
   tests over. Moving some of these tests over revealed issues and these have also been resolved, 
   including \#2927. ([\#2933](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2933))
- Some transactions now use temporary storage (only kept for the duration of
  the tx execution and VPs validation) to indicate what actions were applied to
  validity predicates that use the information to decide who has to authorize
  the transaction. ([\#2934](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2934))
- Change the return type of a VP's predicate function to a Result of unit or
  some error. In case Namada users perform invalid state changes, they should
  be met with more descriptive error messages explaining the cause of their tx's
  rejection. ([\#2940](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2940))
- Return error messages from tx execution, instead of aborting execution with no
  context. ([\#2958](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2958))
- Simplified gas metering for code compilation and validation.

  ([\#2295](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2295))
- Improved validation on transaction's expiration. Added an expiration for MASP
  transfers. ([\#2315](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2315))

### IMPROVMENTS

- Previously, a hardcoded set of tokens were expected to be used in Masp conversions.
  If these tokens did not have configs in genesis, this would lead to a panic after the first
  epoch change. This PR fixes this to use the tokens found in genesis belonging to the MASP
  rewards whitelist instead of hardcoding the tokens.
  ([\#2285](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2285))

### SDK

- Introduce a method to query the status (pending, relayed or expired) of Bridge
  pool transfers ([\#1995](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/1995))
- Added light sdk ([\#2220](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2220))
- Improved the TxResponse type.
  ([\#2276](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2276))
- Removed useless epoch for fee unshielding.
  ([\#2282](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2282))
- ibc-gen-shielded can set non-Namada token
  ([\#2308](https://github.com/anoma/namada/issues/2308))
- Updated `gen_shielded_transfer` to attach a sensible expiration to a MASP
  `Transaction`. ([\#2315](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2315))
- ibc-transfer can set a spending key to the source
  ([\#2321](https://github.com/anoma/namada/issues/2321))

### TESTING

- Added e2e test for change-consensus-key command.
  ([\#2218](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2218))

## v0.28.2

Namada 0.28.2 is a patch release that fixes a stack overflow issue for nodes.

### BUG FIXES

- Fixed DB prefix iterators to avoid iterators with key that don't match the
  given prefix, which was triggering recursive call that was growing stack with
  every new applied tx and on reading state from disk on start-up. Replaced
  recursion from RocksDB that was growing stack size with a loop.
  ([\#2325](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2325))

## v0.28.1

Namada 0.28.1 is a patch release that makes improvements to the MASP, SDK, merkle trees, and chain initialization conditions.

### BUG FIXES

- Fix sdk compilation when using async-send feature flag.
  ([\#2261](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2261))
- Added back missing changed storage keys in transaction results.
  ([\#2263](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2263))
- Fix to skip pruning BridgePool Merkle trees when no signed nonce
  ([\#2264](https://github.com/anoma/namada/issues/2264))
- Initialize token total supply to zero at init chain.
  ([\#2270](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2270))

### IMPROVEMENTS

- Preload and cache MASP verifying keys on ledger start-up.
  ([\#2272](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2272))
- Now join-network will try to look for non validator wallet in more places.
  ([\#2273](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2273))

## v0.28.0

Namada 0.28.0 is a minor release that improves the genesis setup to allow signing with hardware wallet and contains various improvements including validator liveness jailing, accounts simplifications, bug fixes, stability improvements and more.

### BUG FIXES

- Fix the start block height of the first epoch.
  ([\#1993](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/1993))
- Fix Ethereum event validation/state updates when more than one validator is
  running the chain ([\#2035](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2035))
- Fix possible underflow in MASP rewards calculation.
  ([\#2230](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2230))

### IMPROVEMENTS

Allow  the ethereum oracle to be activated / deactivated via config 
updates sent from ledger. This allows governance to shut down the 
ledger without restarts. Otherwise, disconnecting from Ethereum will
result in the ledger crashing.
([\#1764](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/1764))
- Prune merkle tree of bridge pool
  ([\#2110](https://github.com/anoma/namada/issues/2110))
- Revert the chain ID format by upgrading ibc-rs to 0.48.1
  ([\#2153](https://github.com/anoma/namada/issues/2153))
- Changed pre-genesis established addresses to be derived from their data.
  Improved signing of pre-genesis transactions to use the same format as
  regular transactions. Genesis token balances now can be directly assigned to
  established addresses. ([\#2186](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2186))
- Combined the user and the validator VP into one.
  ([\#2202](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2202))
- Charge gas for network usage.
  ([\#2205](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2205))
- A new `tx_become_validator` replaces `tx_init_validator`. This tx doesn't
  initialize a new account and instead it modifies an existing established
  address to become a validator. This currently requires that there are no
  delegations on the source account before it can become a validator (if there
  are some, they have to be unbonded, but they don't have to be withdrawn).
  A new client command `become-validator` is added that requires an `--address`.
  The client command `init-validator` is kept for convenience and updated to
  send `tx_init_account` tx before `tx_become_validator`.
  ([\#2208](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2208))
- Increase hardware wallet support in the CLI
  ([\#2209](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2209))
- Handle errors on loading WASMs from file-system compilation cache.
  ([\#2215](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2215))
- Implement a CLI query for available rewards from a bond,
  and improve the bond amount for rewards computation
  ([\#2217](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2217))
- Fix bug in client to allow for unjailing a validator
  that was jailed for missing liveness requirements
  ([\#2246](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2246))

### MISCELLANEOUS

- Upgraded borsh dependency to v1.2.0.
  ([\#2233](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2233))

### SDK

- Removed uses of lifetimes in the SDKs Namada trait and implementation
  ([\#2225](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2225))
- Added Send trait support to the SDK to allow its use in more multithreaded
  contexts. ([\#2235](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2235))

## v0.27.0

Namada 0.27.0 is a minor release that incorporates the remaining essential proof-of-stake features, updates the MASP and transaction functionality, and provides some additions to the SDK.

  ([\#2163](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2163))
- Improve the validator VP to ensure that only the validator themself
  can execute transactions that manipulate its own validator data
  ([\#2169](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2169))
- Various improvements to the PoS code, including adding a panic on a slashing
  failure, some more checked arithmetics, aesthetic code cleanup, and fixing a
  bug in is_delegator. ([\#2178](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2178))
- Added type tags to transactions to enable hardware wallets
  to fully decode transactions even after minor Namada updates.
  ([\#2182](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2182))
- Save MASP conversion state to the state storage instead of the diffs
  ([\#2189](https://github.com/anoma/namada/issues/2189))

### MISCELLANEOUS

- Removed catching of panics from PoS VP.
  ([\#2145](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2145))

  keys, implicit addresses and shielded keys without having a chain setup. If
  no chain is setup yet (i.e. there's no base-dir or it's empty), the wallet
  defaults to use the pre-genesis wallet even without the `--pre-genesis`
  flag. The pre-genesis wallet is located inside base-dir in
  `pre-genesis/wallet.toml`.

  ([\#1878](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/1878))
- Added the `Send` bound to the `Client` and `ShieldedUtils` `async_trait`s'.
  This allows the SDK to be used in environments which are both asynchronous and

- Public parts of shared `namada` crate have been split up into a
  `namada_core` crate. The `namada_proof_of_stake`, `namada_vp_prelude`
  and `namada_tx_prelude` crates now depend on this `namada_core` crate.
  ([#733](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/733))
