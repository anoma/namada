//! The state machine moves through the following state DAG:
//!
//! 1. [`BuildingProtocolTxBatch`] - the initial state. In this state, we
//!    populate a block with protocol txs.
//! 2. [`BuildingNormalTxBatch`] - the second state. In this state, we populate
//!    a block with non-protocol txs.
//! 3. [`BuildingProtocolTxBatch`] - we return to this state to fill up any
//!    remaining block space if possible.
