# This file contains hand-written unsigned transactions for localnet with:

# - 3 established accounts for "Albert", "Bertha" and "Christel"
# - a bond from "Albert"'s established account to validator-0
#
# Note that 1 localnet user account "Daewon" is left as
# implicit account, so their tokens are kept in the accounts derived from their
# keys used in `balances.toml`.

# This file is used to produce `signed-transactions.toml` with
